    LakeFS naming requirements: ^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{2,62}$

    - Length: 3-63 characters

    GLOBAL format (ALL repos use this):
    Format: {type}-{safe_id[:38]}-{hash[:22]}
    - 1 char: Repo type (m=model, d=dataset, s=space)

    Why hash ORIGINAL repo_id?
    - Sanitization can make different names identical (e.g., "my_repo" vs "my.repo" → "my-repo")
    - Hash ensures uniqueness even after sanitization
    - Hash is ALWAYS included (no escaping)

    Note:
        Base36 encoding (0-9, a-z) provides ~5.17 bits/char
        22 chars × 5.17 = ~113.7 bits (fits 112-bit hash perfectly)

    Generations:
        A repo ID can outlive the LakeFS repository it maps to: renaming a repo
        deletes the old LakeFS repository, and LakeFS deletes asynchronously, so
        the derived name stays taken for a while afterwards (issue #93). The
        layout above is exactly 63 chars - the LakeFS maximum - so there is no
        room to append a generation token. The generation goes into the *hash
        input* instead:

            generation 0 -> hash(repo_id)            (legacy value, unchanged)
            generation N -> hash(f"{repo_id}#{N}")

        Generation 0 must stay byte-identical to the pre-generation scheme:
        existing rows are backfilled with it by migration 016, and any drift
        would point stored ids at LakeFS repositories that do not exist.

    Args:
        repo_type: Repository type (model/dataset/space)
        repo_id: Full repository ID (e.g., "org/repo-name")
        generation: Which incarnation of this repo ID to name. Allocate it with
            `allocate_lakefs_repo_name` rather than guessing.

    Returns:
        LakeFS-safe repository name (always 63 chars)

    Examples:
        - "model", "org/simple" → "m" + "-" + "org-simple" (38 chars) + "-" + hash(22 chars)
